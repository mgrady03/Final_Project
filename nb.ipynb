    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data-driven approach. I will analyze various metrics from datasets provided by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to make an informed decision on what constitutes the \"best\" neighborhood.\n",

    "**Approach and Metric Development:**\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach involves developing a metric based on factors such as crime rates, infrastructure quality, and socioeconomic indicators."

    "**Reflection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data-driven determination of the best neighborhood aligns closely with my personal favorite, but the metrics provided deeper insights into what makes a neighborhood "better" than the others. While personal preferences may lean towards outward appearance, the data reaffirms that factors like safety, infrastructure, and community are crucial in defining the best neighborhood.\n",
