    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data-driven approach. I will analyze various metrics from datasets provided by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to make an informed decision on what constitutes the \"best\" neighborhood.\n",

    "**Approach and Metric Development:**\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach involves developing a metric based on factors such as crime rates, infrastructure quality, and socioeconomic indicators."
