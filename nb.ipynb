    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data-driven approach. We will analyze various metrics from datasets provided by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to make an informed decision on what constitutes the \"best\" neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves developing a metric based on factors such as crime rates, infrastructure quality, and socioeconomic indicators. We will explore alternative metrics considered during the project's development."

    "\n",
    "The data-driven determination of the best neighborhood aligns closely with my personal favorite, but the metrics have provided deeper insights into what makes a neighborhood truly exceptional. While personal preferences may lean towards aesthetics or personal experiences, the data reaffirms that factors like safety, infrastructure, and community support are critical in defining the best neighborhood.\n",
